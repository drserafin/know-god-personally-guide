        <h1>Would You Like to Know God Personally?</h1>
        <p>What does it take to begin a relationship with God? Do you need to devote yourself
            to unselfish religious deeds? Must you become a better person so that God will accept you? You'll be surprised that none of those things will work.
            But God has made it abundantly clear in the Bible how we can know Him. The following principles will explain how you can personally begin a relationship with God, right now through Jesus Christ.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 23px;">"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." (John 3:16, NIV)</p>
        
        <h3 style="color: rgb(0, 92, 60); font-size: 25px;">GOD'S PLAN</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 23px;">Jesus said, “I came that they might have life, and might have it abundantly” (John 10:10, ESV) — that is, that life might be full and meaningful.</p>
